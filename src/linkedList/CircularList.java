 * Created by farazw808 on 7/9/14.
 * Create algorithm which finds out if given list is circular or not.
 * Are we given head or any node member. The problem is solvable in O(n) time.
 * It is classic tricky problem. We dont know where list loop itself and we need to find that node is.
 * This problem will be solved by two running pointers, one of which is 2X faster than first.
